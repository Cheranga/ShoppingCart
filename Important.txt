Deploying Web API
-----------------
1.	Remember the app pool need to be in .NET V4 or higher.
2.	Host the service by "Adding new site".
3.	If needed give access rights to the application pool.

git rm --cached -r mydirectory


Getting data in JSONP format
----------------------------

After the service have been deployed it's in a different domain. So need to send the request as a jsonp request.

	The error probably you'll get is
	--------------------------------
	“No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource” 



So to get data follow these steps.

1.	First when calling the service from script append "?callback=?" to the end of the URL.
	(You don't want to specify this if you use $.ajax method with option 'dataType' set to 'jsonp')

2.	The API service should support JSONP format as well. So for that install Nuget package (WebApiContrib.Formatting.Jsonp), and add it as a formatter to the web api project.
